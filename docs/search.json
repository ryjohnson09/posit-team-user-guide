As the name implies, Posit Workbench contains numerous “tools” for insight development, including a variety of integrated development environments (IDEs) to choose from. Currently, Posit Workbench supports Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, RStudio Pro and Visual Studio Code (Figure 2.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Posit Workbench - New session options\n\n\n\nThe IDEs included within Posit Workbench will look and feel very similar to the versions that are freely available to the public. This is by design to ensure users feel at home within Posit Workbench on day one. There are, however, a few features that you will only find within Posit Workbench which will be discussed in the next section.\n\n2.1.1.1 Features unique to Posit Workbench\nMany of the features that make Posit Workbench appealing for data science teams are tailored to system administrators, IT, and security teams including load balancing, cluster integration, authentication, session management, and security. From the users perspective, there are a handful of features that are worth knowing about which you’ll only find within Posit Workbench including:\n\nFlexible use of multiple versions of R and Python on the same server.\nProject sharing (RStudio Pro) for easy collaboration within work groups.\nLaunch long-running scripts (R and Python) in new sessions independent of your current working session.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Posit Connect\nData scientists leverage Posit Connect to share insights with others (Figure 2.1). These insights can take many forms including interactive web applications, static reports, application programming interfaces (APIs), and more. Once the insights have been published to Connect (possibly from Posit Workbench), the publisher has full control over sharing, access, and content execution.\n\n2.1.2.1 Publishing Options\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Publishing methods\n\n\n\nUsers have multiple options for publishing content to Posit Connect, summarized in Figure 2.4.\n\nCommand Line: The rsconnect-python package contains a command line interface (CLI) tools for publishing content from the command line/terminal. During the publishing process, the user’s environment with automatically be captured and replicated on the Posit Connect server. This method is available anywhere you have access to a terminal/command line, including Jupyter Lab and VS Code.\nPush-Button Deployment: Available within RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks (within Posit Workbench). During the publishing process, the user’s environment with automatically be captured and replicated on the Posit Connect server.\nR: The rsconnect R package makes it easy to publish content to Posit Connect from R.\nGit: Deploy content directly from a git repository. In this method, the user needs to supply a companion manifest.json file which includes information about the environment needed to run the content on Posit Connect.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Posit Package Manager\nData scientists leverage Posit Package Manager to access R and Python packages from repositories managed and hosted from within your organization. Often, Posit Package Manager is considered a “behind the scenes” tool, but it’s importance should not be underestimated. Users of Posit Package Manager often find that their package installs and development environments “just work” without any prior configuration. However, it’s still important that users know how to install packages from an instance of Posit Package Manager.",

The repository URL can be found within the SETUP page within Posit Package Manager.\nSince this configuration is done within an active R session, you’ll need to repeat these steps anytime you open a new session. Consider adding this code to your .Rprofile file to maintain the repository configuration across R sessions.\nYou can also set the repository URL using the RStudio IDE by navigating to Tools –&gt; Global Options –&gt; Packages, and adding the repository URL to the “Primary CRAN repository” text box.",

    "text": "4.2 A Primer on Databases\nDatabases are managed by DataBase Management Systems (DBMSs). There exists a growing list of DBMSs for databases hosted on-prem (client server), in the Cloud, or in-process. Below are a few common DBMSs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Database Management Systems\n\n\n\nIn R, there exists an interface layer between the R programming language and the DBMS. This is know as the DataBase Interface (DBI). To make a connection to a DBMS from R, you use the DBI::dbConnect() function in combination with an R package tailored for the DBMS you are connecting to. For example, here is some R code to connect to a PostgreSQL database:\ncon &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(\n  RPostgres::Postgres(), \n  hostname = \"databases.mycompany.com\", \n  port = 1234\n)\nIn Python, the database interface layer is an API known as the Python DataBase API (DB-API). Most packages and modules in Python used to access DBMSs are often designed to be DB-API compliant including sqlite3, psycopg2, and mysql-connector-python. For example, here is some Python code to connect to a SQLite database:\ncon = sqlite3.connect('example.db')\nWith so many DBMS-specific connectors, it can be overwhelming to remember which package/function to use. As such, most DBMSs will also provide a connector known as an Open DataBase Connectivity (ODBC) driver. ODBC is a universal DBMS interface, which means the same ODBC functions will work with any database. For example, here is how to make an ODBC connection to a PostgreSQL database in R and Python:\n# In R\nlibrary(DBI)\nlibrary(odbc)\n\ncon &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),\n  driver = \"PostgreSQL Driver\",\n  database = \"test_db\",\n  UID    = Sys.getenv(\"DB_USER\"),\n  PWD    = Sys.getenv(\"DB_PASSWORD\"),\n  host = \"localhost\",\n  port = 5432)\n# In Python\nimport pyodbc\n\ncon = pyodbc.connect(\n  driver = 'PostgreSQL',\n  database = 'test_db',\n  server = 'localhost',\n  port = 5432, \n  uid = os.getenv('DB_USER'),\n  pwd = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')\n)",

    "text": "6.2 MLOps with vetiver\nGiven the iterative nature of the ML life cycle, there exists tools explicitly designed to assist with the deployment and maintenance (i.e. “operations”) of ML models. This practice is known as Machine Learning Operations, or MLOps. Posit has created a MLOps framework for both R and Python known as vetiver. vetiver was designed to fill the tool gap in the ML life cycle around versioning, deploying, and monitoring model performance.\n\n6.2.1 vetiver workflow with Posit Team\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(Convert model to\\nvetiver model) --&gt; B(Pin vetiver model\\nto Posit Connect)\n  B --&gt; C(Serve vetiver model\\nas an API)\n  C --&gt; D(Make a prediction!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA typical vetiver workflow within Posit Team, depicted in the flow diagram above, consists of converting a model to a vetiver model, saving it to Posit Connect as a pin, and then serving it as an API. This workflow is shown below in both Python and R. Be sure to substitute “your_name” with your Posit Connect username:\n\nPythonR\n\n\nimport pins\nfrom vetiver import VetiverModel\nfrom vetiver.data import mtcars\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\n# Create Model\nmodel = LinearRegression().fit(mtcars.drop(columns=\"mpg\"), mtcars[\"mpg\"])\n\n# Create Vetiver Model\nv = VetiverModel(model, model_name = \"your_name/cars_linear\", \n                 prototype_data = mtcars.drop(columns=\"mpg\"))\n\n# Save Model as pin\nboard = pins.board_connect(allow_pickle_read = True)\nvetiver_pin_write(board, v)\n\n\nlibrary(vetiver)\nlibrary(pins)\n\n# Create Model\ncars_lm &lt;- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)\n\n# Create Vetiver Model\nv &lt;- vetiver_model(cars_lm, \"your_name/cars_linear\")\n\n# Save Model as pin\nboard &lt;- board_connect()\nvetiver_pin_write(board, v)\n\n\n\nNow that we have a model saved to Posit Connect, we can use vetiver to serve it as an API. By default, vetiver will use FastAPI for python models, and plumber for R models. Creating APIs is a cinch with vetiver:\n\nPythonR\n\n\nfrom vetiver import deploy_rsconnect\nfrom rsconnect.api import RSConnectServer\nimport os\n\n# Define Connect Server\nconnect_server = RSConnectServer(\n    url=os.getenv(\"CONNECT_SERVER\"), \n    api_key=os.getenv(\"CONNECT_API_KEY\")\n)\n\n# Convert pinned model on Connect to API\ndeploy_rsconnect(board = board, \n                 pin_name = \"you_name/cars_linear\", \n                 connect_server = connect_server)\n\n\nlibrary(plumber)\nlibrary(rsconnect)\n\n# Convert pinned model on Connect to API\nvetiver_deploy_rsconnect(board = board, \n                         name = \"your_name/cars_linear\")\n\n\n\nIn some cases, you may need to add some additional arguments to these functions (e.g., Posit Connect server URL and API key). Additional details can be found on the Posit Connect user guide.\n\n\n6.2.2 Interacting with APIs on Posit Connect\nHuman interactions with an API usually requires a visualization layer. When creating an API for your model with vetiver, the default visual documentation for Plumber is swagger, and for FastAPI it’s RapiDoc. Below is an example of the RapiDoc documentatin of a FastAPI hosted on Posit Connect:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: RapiDoc documentation for a FastAPI hosted on Posit Connect\n\n\n\nThis example API uses a model to predict the number of COVID cases given a specific day of the year. You will create a similar API in the next exercise! The prediction is generated by sending a POST request to the API with specific parameters. In this case, there is only one parameter, the day of the year (DayOfYear). RapiDoc allows you to try out the API. In the image below, we asked the API to return the prediction of the number of COVID cases on day 46 of the year. At the bottom, you can see the response of approximately 1,033 cases:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Interacting with RapiDoc\n\n\n\nYou can also interact with APIs programmatically. In the code below, we’ll show you how to query an API using vetiver hosted on Posit Connect using both R and Python. Full instructions (including additional authentication options) can be found here.\n\nPythonR\n\n\nfrom vetiver.server import predict, vetiver_endpoint\n\n# Define the API endpoint\nendpoint = vetiver_endpoint(\n    f\"https://connect.example.com/content/{APP_ID}/predict\"\n)\n\n# If API has restricted access, you'll need to supply an API Key\napi_key=os.getenv(\"CONNECT_API_KEY\")\n\n# Predict using new data!\nh = {\"Authorization\": f\"Key {api_key}\"}\nresponse = predict(endpoint=endpoint, data=new_data, headers=h)\n\n\n# Define the API endpoint\nendpoint &lt;- vetiver_endpoint(\n  \"https://connect.example.com/content/$APP_ID/predict\")\n\n# If API has restricted access, you'll need to supply an API Key\napiKey &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"CONNECT_API_KEY\")\n\n# Predict using new data!\npredict(\n  endpoint,\n  new_data,\n  httr::add_headers(Authorization = paste(\"Key\", apiKey)))",

This often leads to bloated applications that are frustratingly slow (see left side of Figure 8.1). Instead, it’s recommended to decouple the “computationally heavy” parts of your workflow from your shiny application where possible (see right side of Figure 8.1). Consider the two examples below (both of which we’ve discussed in previous chapters):\n\nIf your shiny application relies on large datasets, make sure to only read in the data required for the application. Also consider pre-processing your data before reading it into the shiny application.\nIf your shiny application leverages a machine learning model, consider training/tuning your model outside of shiny and serving it as an API.\n\nBy keeping the steps of your workflow independent from each other, you can dramatically improve your shiny application’s performance and simplify the underlying code. These are two big steps for making your shiny applications more production grade!",
