This workshop teaches how to use Posit Team and data science best practices using a read data science project. The data is a exerpt from the [gapminder data set](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) and the project goal is to use this data to create and serve a model that predicts the life expectancy at birth based on various predictors such as country, year, population, and per-capita GDP.

This project lives on GitHub here: <https://github.com/ryjohnson09/gapminder-analysis.git>

## Create an RStudio Project

There are several ways to bring a project from a Git repository into your development environment. In this workshop, we will do so by creating a new RStudio Project.

## Step 1: Create a New RStudio Project

Navigate to RStudio and select `File --> New Project`. In the pop-up window, select `Version Control`.

## Step 2: Select `git`

Since we are pulling in a project from GitHub, select `git`.

## Step 3: Add info and create project

Add in the GitHub repo URL (`https://github.com/ryjohnson09/gapminder-analysis.git`) and give the project directory a name. `gapminder-analysis` is suitable, but you can name it whatever you would like. Then click **Create Project**.

## Project Structure

The project follows a *project oriented workflow* in that each piece of content associated with the workflow is contained within a separate RStudio Project (R) or virtual environment (Python). To manage the packages for each piece of content, we use `renv` for R (renv.lock file) and a `requirements.txt` file for Python. The entire project is tracked using a top-level git repository.
