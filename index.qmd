This book is a companion to the live Posit Team User training workshop hosted by Posit.

Posit Team is a bundled offering of Posit's three professional data science tools: Posit Workbench, Posit Connect, and Posit Workbench. **For this book, we consider Posit Team users to be data scientists that are writing code and developing data products (e.g., Shiny applications and Quarto documents)**.
